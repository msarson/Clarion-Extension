# Client Managers

This directory contains manager classes that handle different aspects of the Clarion Extension client functionality. The refactoring was done to improve code organization, maintainability, and testability.

## Manager Classes

### LanguageServerManager

Handles the initialization and communication with the Language Server Protocol (LSP) server.

- Starts and stops the language server
- Manages client-server communication
- Handles server readiness state

### FileWatcherManager

Manages file system watchers for solution-related files.

- Creates watchers for solution files, project files, and redirection files
- Handles file change events
- Notifies other components when files change

### ViewManager

Manages the tree views and other UI components.

- Creates and refreshes the solution tree view
- Creates and refreshes the structure view
- Handles view-related commands like filtering

### ConfigurationManager

Manages configuration settings and status bar.

- Updates the configuration status bar
- Handles configuration changes
- Extracts configurations from solution files

### SolutionManager

Manages solution initialization, environment setup, and document management.

- Initializes the solution
- Manages the document manager
- Handles workspace trust
- Refreshes open documents

### CommandManager

Registers and manages extension commands.

- Registers all commands
- Handles command execution
- Organizes commands by functionality

## Usage

Each manager class follows the singleton pattern and can be accessed using its respective getter function:

```typescript
import { getLanguageServerManager } from './managers/LanguageServerManager';
import { getFileWatcherManager } from './managers/FileWatcherManager';
import { getViewManager } from './managers/ViewManager';
import { getConfigurationManager } from './managers/ConfigurationManager';
import { getSolutionManager } from './managers/SolutionManager';
import { getCommandManager } from './managers/CommandManager';

// Get manager instances
const languageServerManager = getLanguageServerManager();
const fileWatcherManager = getFileWatcherManager();
const viewManager = getViewManager();
const configurationManager = getConfigurationManager();
const solutionManager = getSolutionManager();
const commandManager = getCommandManager();

// Use manager methods
const client = languageServerManager.getClient();
await fileWatcherManager.createSolutionFileWatchers(context);
await viewManager.createSolutionTreeView(context);
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Each manager has a clear, focused responsibility.
2. **Better Maintainability**: Smaller, more focused files are easier to understand and modify.
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Manager classes can be tested in isolation.
4. **Reduced Complexity**: The main extension.ts file is now much simpler and easier to understand.
5. **Easier Extension**: New functionality can be added by extending existing managers or creating new ones.
