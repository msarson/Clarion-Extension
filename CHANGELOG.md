- ✨ Hover documentation for Clarion compiler directives: `ITEMIZE`, `SECTION` (new); existing `ASSERT`, `BEGIN`, `COMPILE`, `EQUATE`, `INCLUDE`, `OMIT`, `SIZE` already covered
- ✨ Builtin hover now narrows overloads by first-argument type — e.g. hovering `OPEN(Window)` shows only the `WINDOW` overloads, not all 8 signatures; labels are enriched with `structureType` (FILE, VIEW, WINDOW, REPORT, etc.) during document processing (#74)

- 🐛 Equate hover no longer shows `UNKNOWN` as the type (e.g. `Resize:LockWidth EQUATE(00000001b)` now shows `EQUATE` correctly)
- 🐛 Equate hover now correctly shows `EQUATE` type for equates declared with a space before the parenthesis (e.g. `CREATE:combo EQUATE (15)`)
- 🐛 Equate hover now shows "Global constant" / "Module constant" instead of "Global variable" for `EQUATE` declarations
- 🐛 `LIKE(TypeName)` dot-access chains now resolve correctly in hover and Go To Definition — e.g. `SELF.OrigWin.Maximized` where `OrigWin` is declared `LIKE(WindowPositionGroup)` now navigates to the `Maximized` field in the GROUP; colon-qualified names such as `LIKE(PYA:RECORD)` are also supported (closes #76)

See [0.9.3] below for full details.

---

### [0.9.3] - 2026-04-19

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **Fix diagnostics flashing then disappearing on file open** — Discarded-return-value warnings were emitted immediately on `onDidOpen` (107 warnings in test cases) then cleared to zero ~30ms later when `solutionReady` re-validated the same document. Root cause: `DocumentStructure.process()` was being called **twice** on the same token array — once inside `ClarionTokenizer.tokenize()` and once in `TokenCache.getTokens()`. Because `process()` mutates tokens in-place and is not idempotent, the second pass corrupted `MapProcedure` subType assignments (count ballooned from 21 → 178 in affected files), which caused the deduplication logic in `validateDiscardedReturnValuesForPlainCalls` to move all procedures into the `excluded` set → 0 diagnostics. Fixed by: (1) storing the `DocumentStructure` instance created inside `ClarionTokenizer.processDocumentStructure()` and exposing it via `getDocumentStructure()`; (2) having `TokenCache.getTokens()` reuse that instance instead of constructing a new one and calling `process()` again; (3) skipping `processDocumentStructure()` on the partial-line tokenizer used in the incremental update path (the final merged-token `DocumentStructure.process()` is the single authoritative pass). Also fixed `DocumentStructure.buildParentIndex()` which was called in the constructor before `process()` had set `finishesAt` and `subType` values — it is now rebuilt at the end of `process()` using the fully populated token data.

**Tokenizer & Outline**

- 🐛 **Fix WINDOW (and other structure keywords) used as labels in the outline** ([#68](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/68)) — the Clarion language spec explicitly allows `WINDOW`, `CLASS`, `FILE`, `GROUP`, `QUEUE`, `VIEW`, `RECORD`, `MAP`, `MODULE`, `INTERFACE`, and `REPORT` to be used as data-structure labels. The tokenizer's Label pattern was incorrectly excluding all of these keywords via a negative lookahead, so a line like `Window  WINDOW('Caption'),...` caused `W` to be silently skipped and `indow` to be produced as a spurious Variable token. This left the WINDOW structure with no label, resulting in two outline entries instead of one. Fixed by removing all structure keywords from the Label exclusion list (keeping only the truly reserved words: `COMPILE`, `OMIT`, `EMBED`, `SECTION`, `ENDSECTION`, `INCLUDE`, `PROGRAM`, `MEMBER`, `END`). The `PatternMatcher` `lower` charClass was also missing `TokenType.Label`, meaning lowercase-starting labels such as `window` were never matched as labels; this has been corrected.

**Formatter**

- 🔧 **Fix document formatter — 6 bugs resolved** ([#66](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/66)):
  - 🐛 Procedures and routines were not being detected correctly due to a wrong `subType` check, causing local data sections and execution ranges to be misidentified.
  - 🐛 Single-line structures (open and close on the same line) were indented using a hardcoded minimum instead of the current indent stack level.
  - 🐛 Formatted output always used CRLF regardless of the source file's line endings; the formatter now preserves the original EOL style.
  - 🐛 Dot-notation method implementations (e.g. `ThisWindow.Init PROCEDURE`) lost the dot — the formatter emitted `ThisWindow  Init PROCEDURE`. The full label text including dot is now preserved.
  - 🐛 `CLASS`/`GROUP`/`QUEUE` declarations inside a procedure's local data section were treated as flat variables. This caused the structure body (`END` and member declarations) to use incorrect indentation. Structures now push to the indent stack even inside local data sections.
  - 🐛 Within a `CLASS` body, each method's `PROCEDURE` keyword was aligned independently per label length, producing ragged columns. All method keywords now align to a single shared column determined by the longest method label in the class.
  - 🐛 `CLASS` keyword column in a local data section did not match the type-keyword column of surrounding variable declarations. It now uses the same `snap0(maxLabel+1)` formula as all other local data lines.

**Diagnostics**

- 🐛 **Diagnose reserved keywords used as labels** ([#69](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/69)) — the Clarion language spec defines two categories of reserved words. *Fully reserved* keywords (`RETURN`, `WHILE`, `CYCLE`, `GOTO`, `PROCEDURE`, etc.) may never be used as labels. *Structure-only* keywords (`WINDOW`, `CLASS`, `QUEUE`, etc.) may label data structures but not `PROCEDURE` or `FUNCTION` declarations. The new `LabelDiagnostics` validator flags both violations as errors. Matching is case-insensitive (Clarion is case-insensitive). Valid uses — such as `WINDOW` labelling a `WINDOW` structure, or `CLASS` labelling a `CLASS` structure — are not flagged.

**Code Actions**

- ✨ **Flatten continuation lines** (`Ctrl+.` → "Flatten continuation lines") ([#70](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/70)) — Clarion uses `|` at end-of-line to continue long expressions across multiple source lines. A new Code Action appears (via the lightbulb or `Ctrl+.`) whenever the cursor is on a line that is part of a `|` continuation group. Activating it joins the group into a single line, trimming leading whitespace from continuation lines and collapsing adjacent string literals joined by `&` (e.g. `'abc' & 'def'` → `'abcdef'`). When a selection spanning multiple lines is active, only the selected lines are flattened; otherwise the full continuation group around the cursor is found automatically. The `|` detection is string-safe: a pipe character inside a Clarion string literal (including strings with `''` escaped quotes) is never treated as a continuation marker.

**Editor Navigation**

- ✨ **Expand Selection through structure nesting** (`Shift+Alt+→` / `Shift+Alt+←`) ([#71](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/71)) — the extension now implements the LSP `SelectionRangeProvider`. Pressing **Shift+Alt+→** progressively widens the selection through Clarion's scope hierarchy: current token → current line → innermost containing structure/procedure/routine → parent structure → … → whole document. **Shift+Alt+←** shrinks back through the same chain. Works for all container types: `PROCEDURE`, `ROUTINE`, `CLASS`, `WINDOW`, `QUEUE`, `GROUP`, `RECORD`, `FILE`, `VIEW`, `REPORT`, etc.

- ✨ **CodeLens: inline reference counts above procedures** ([#72](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/72)) — the editor now shows `N references` (or `1 reference`) inline above each procedure and CLASS declaration, similar to TypeScript/C# support in VS Code. The count is computed lazily (resolve phase) so it only runs for lenses visible in the viewport, not the whole file at once. Clicking the lens opens the standard References panel at that symbol. Shows `0 references` too — useful for spotting dead code.

- 🐛 **Fix false-positive "unreachable code" after multiple sequential `IF..RETURN..END` blocks** ([#67](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/67))— when a string literal in a Trace call (e.g. `Trace('...function pointers...')`) appeared on a line before the second `IF`, the tokenizer matched the word `function` inside the string and incorrectly reset `inCodeSection = false`. This caused the second `IF` to be skipped as an "execution structure before CODE", leaving `UnreachableCodeProvider` with no stack entry for it. Any subsequent `RETURN` inside that block then appeared at procedure level, causing all code after the `IF..END` to be flagged as unreachable. Fixed by stripping string literals (and comments) from the line before checking for `PROCEDURE`/`FUNCTION` keywords.

- ⚠️ **Warn on discarded plain MAP/MODULE procedure return values**([#51](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/51)) — a new warning fires when a plain (non-dot-access) call to a MAP or MODULE procedure that returns a value is used as a statement without capturing the result. Covers procedures declared directly in a `MAP` block, inside a `MODULE(...)` within a MAP, and in local procedure MAPs. Cross-file detection is supported: procedures declared in a global MAP in the program file (or any other cached file) are also checked when called from a MEMBER file. Add the `PROC` attribute to the declaration, or assign the return value, to suppress the warning.
- ⚠️ **Warn on BREAK/CYCLE outside LOOP or ACCEPT** ([#64](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/64)) — a new warning fires when `BREAK` or `CYCLE` appears outside any `LOOP` or `ACCEPT` structure. Both constructs are valid anywhere inside a `LOOP` or `ACCEPT` block (including nested blocks). Labeled forms (`BREAK Label` / `CYCLE Label`) are excluded from this check as they are addressed separately in issue #65.

**Code Quality**

- 🔧 **Refactor DiagnosticProvider into focused sub-modules** — the 1943-line `DiagnosticProvider.ts` has been split into four focused helper modules in `server/src/providers/diagnostics/`: `StructureDiagnostics.ts`, `ClassDiagnostics.ts`, `ReturnValueDiagnostics.ts`, and `ControlFlowDiagnostics.ts`. `DiagnosticProvider` is now a thin facade that delegates to these modules, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

**Hover**

- ✨ **Hover documentation for `PROP:` and `PROPPRINT:` runtime properties** ([#73](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/73)) — hovering over any Clarion runtime property equate now shows documentation sourced from the Clarion 11.1 Language Reference. Covers 336 `PROP:` entries (window/control/file/system properties) and 25 `PROPPRINT:` printer control properties (`PROPPRINT:Device`, `PROPPRINT:Copies`, `PROPPRINT:Paper`, etc.). Read-only properties are labelled accordingly. `PROPPRINT:` hovers show a printer-appropriate usage example (`PRINTER{PROPPRINT:Device}`). Works wherever property equates appear in code.
- ✨ **Hover and autocomplete for `EVENT:` equates** ([#74](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/74)) — hovering over any Clarion event equate (e.g. `EVENT:Accepted`, `EVENT:CloseWindow`, `EVENT:Timer`) now shows a description, category (Field-Specific / Field-Independent / DDE), and a usage example. Autocomplete fires when typing `EVENT:` (or after the colon), listing all 62 event equates with category and description in the detail column. DDE events are included.

### [0.9.2] - 2026-04-18

**Performance Fixes**

- 🚀 **Replace `ClassDefinitionIndexer` with `StructureDeclarationIndexer`** — the legacy `ClassDefinitionIndexer` only covered CLASS/QUEUE/GROUP and used a per-file sequential scan. The new `StructureDeclarationIndexer` covers CLASS, INTERFACE, QUEUE, GROUP, RECORD, FILE, VIEW, EQUATE, and ITEMIZE equates; stores 0-based line numbers canonically; and exposes a simpler API (`find`, `findInFile`, `getOrBuildIndex`). All 8 callers (MemberLocatorService, ClassMemberResolver, HoverProvider, MethodHoverResolver, VariableHoverResolver, ClassConstantsCodeActionProvider, ReferencesProvider, DefinitionProvider) have been migrated to use the new indexer directly, and the legacy class has been deleted.

**Diagnostics**

- ⚠️ **Warn on discarded method return values** ([#61](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/61)) — a new warning diagnostic fires when a dot-access method call that returns a value (and lacks the `PROC` attribute) is used as a statement with no capture. Reuses the same cross-file type resolution path as hover and F12 so results stay consistent. The async resolution pass is re-triggered after the solution finishes loading so files opened before the solution is ready are still validated. `SELF`/`PARENT` calls inside class method implementations are resolved via the implementation label. Assignments (`obj.Field = value`) and chained expressions are correctly excluded.

**Performance Fixes**

- 🚀 **Eliminate unnecessary disk reads in hot paths** ([#59](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/59)) — replaced `readFileSync` + O(n²) scans with token cache lookups across three providers:
  - `VariableHoverResolver`: O(n²) backward scan to find enclosing CLASS replaced with `DocumentStructure.getClasses()` range check (O(n) → O(k) where k = class count)
  - `SymbolFinderService.extractTypeInfo`: three sequential O(n) `filter/indexOf` passes collapsed into a single `lineTokens` build
  - `MemberLocatorService`: full token-based `findMemberFromTokens` / `extractMembersFromTokens` fast-path; disk-based fallback retained for uncached files
  - `ImplementationProvider.searchFileForMethodImplementation`: checks token cache first; single-candidate case returns without any disk read
  - `DefinitionProvider` equates fallback: skips `readFileSync` when equates.clw is already in the token cache
- 🐛 **Fix token cache overwrite in `MemberLocatorService`** — synthetic `TextDocument(version=1)` objects used for cross-file lookups no longer overwrite live editor tokens; providers now use `getTokensByUri` first and only fall back to `getTokens` for uncached files
- 🚀 **Structure/outline view no longer freezes during rapid undo** — added a `maxWait` of 1500ms to the document-change debounce so the structure tree always refreshes within 1.5 s even when the user holds Ctrl+Z continuously (previously the 500 ms rolling debounce reset on every undo step, starving the refresh indefinitely)
- 🚀 **Parallelize CLASS index build** — `ClassDefinitionIndexer.buildIndex` now scans all `.inc` files concurrently (`Promise.all`) instead of one-at-a-time; on large installations with hundreds of libsrc files this is 10–100× faster. Added always-on timing logs so build duration is visible in the Output channel.
- 🚀 **Eliminate hover/F12 hang on cursor movement** — `DocumentHighlightProvider` (occurrence highlighting, triggered by VS Code on every cursor move) was calling `ReferencesProvider.provideReferences()` which performed a full cross-file scan of all project source files then discarded every result outside the current file. On a 40-project solution this blocked the LSP event loop for 3–8 seconds on every cursor movement, preventing hover and F12 from running. `DocumentHighlightProvider` has been rewritten with a fast local token-cache scan (O(n) over current file tokens, synchronous, <1ms).
- ✨ **Client logs routed to VS Code Output channel** — log messages from the extension client side are now written to a `"Clarion Extension (Client)"` output channel in VS Code, making client-side diagnostics visible without needing a separate developer tools console.

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **F12 now works for procedure parameters** — pressing F12 on a parameter name inside a procedure body (or inside a local class method body that can access the outer procedure's parameters) now navigates to the parameter declaration in the `PROCEDURE()` signature. Previously `DefinitionProvider` only searched column-0 labels and never found parameters. `DefinitionProvider` now delegates to `SymbolFinderService.findParameter` — the same code path already used by hover — so both providers share one source of truth for parameter resolution.
- 🔧 **Share type-definition SDI lookup between hover and F12** — `SymbolFinderService.findIndexedTypeDeclaration()` is now the single source of truth for looking up named types (CLASS, INTERFACE, QUEUE, GROUP, etc.) via the `StructureDeclarationIndexer`. Both `HoverProvider._checkClassTypeHoverInternal` and `DefinitionProvider.findClassTypeDefinition` delegate to this shared method; the hover-only include-verification guard (`IncludeVerifier.isClassIncluded`) remains exclusively in `HoverProvider`, so F12 navigation behaviour is unchanged.
- 🐛 **Hover: show both declaration and implementation for inherited class methods**— `SELF.Method()` hover on methods inherited from a parent class defined in an `.inc` file (e.g. `WindowManager.SetAlerts` from `ABWINDOW.INC`) was only showing the declaration. The fix reads the `MODULE('...')` attribute from the class definition to locate the correct `.clw` implementation file via redirection, rather than guessing from the `.inc` filename. Local classes (declared in `.clw`) are unaffected.
- 🐛 **Hover for `LOC:`-prefixed procedure parameters** ([#60](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/60)) — hovering over `LOC:Test` inside a procedure body where the parameter is declared as `PROCEDURE(STRING LOC:test)` now shows the correct type. The parameter extraction regex previously only matched simple identifiers; it now handles `PREFIX:Name` style parameter names and matches both the full prefixed form (`LOC:test`) and the bare name (`test`).
- 🐛 **F12 on overloaded class method implementations now resolves the correct overload** — `MethodOverloadResolver` was scanning for `TokenType.Label` tokens at column 0, but class member methods are tokenized as `Procedure/MethodDeclaration` with an indented label. Fixed to use the class token's `children[]` array (populated by `DocumentStructure`) for direct matching by label and subType. Also removed an incorrect `line > 0` filter that excluded classes declared at the top of a file.
- 🐛 **Find All References no longer triggers on attribute keywords** — words like `ONCE` in `INCLUDE('file.inc'),ONCE` were silently triggering a full cross-file reference scan. Added an `isAttributeKeyword()` early-exit guard to `ReferencesProvider` (same pattern used in `HoverRouter`).
- 🐛 **Find All References no longer hangs on locally-defined class methods** — when running "Find All References" on a method declared in a CLASS body inside the current MEMBER file (e.g. `TakeAccepted PROCEDURE(),DERIVED` in `MetroForm CLASS(ce_MetroWizardForm)` declared inside `Main PROCEDURE` with no `MODULE` attribute), the provider was scanning all source files in every project in the solution, causing an indefinite hang on large solutions. If the class is declared in the current document and has no `MODULE` attribute, the search is now restricted to the current file only. Added a 15-second timeout guard on `textDocument/references` as a safety net.
- ✨ **Multi-level variable chain hover/F12/Ctrl+F12** — `variable.property.method` chains now resolve correctly through CLASS, QUEUE, and GROUP types. For example `thisStartup.Settings.PutGlobalSetting(...)` fully resolves: `thisStartup` → its declared class, `.Settings` → the property type, `.PutGlobalSetting` → the method on that type. Hover shows the correct declaration, F12 navigates to it, and Ctrl+F12 finds the implementation.
- 🐛 **Fix hover/F12 for `PREFIX:Name` reference variables** — variables declared with a colon in their name (e.g. `Access:IBSDataSets &DirectFM,THREAD`) were incorrectly resolved: the old code stripped the prefix before the colon and found an unrelated `IBSDataSets FILE` declaration. Hover and F12 now search the MEMBER parent using the full label name first, so `Access:IBSDataSets` correctly navigates to the reference variable declaration.
- 🐛 **Remove colon-stripping fallback from hover and F12** — a general colon-stripping fallback was stripping `Prefix:` from variable names before searching, causing wrong matches. This fallback is unnecessary because the word extractor already returns the full `Prefix:Name` label (colons are treated as word characters). Structure prefix fields (`PRE(x)` notation) are correctly handled by `findPrefixFieldTokenInChain` without needing this fallback.
- 🐛 **Suppress hover/F12/Ctrl+F12 inside string literals** — hovering or pressing F12/Ctrl+F12 on text inside a quoted string (e.g. `'ContainsSpaces'`) was incorrectly triggering symbol resolution. All three providers now bail out immediately when the cursor falls within a `String` token's span.

**Tests**

- 🔧 **Fix test state pollution in `DefinitionProvider.test.ts`** — added `TokenCache.clearTokens` teardown to all `🔒 Behavior Lock` suites; the `LOC:Field` prefixed variable test was failing only due to cached state from a prior test
- 🧹 **Test suite cleanup** — removed 9 pre-existing pending tests: deleted `UnlabeledGroupNesting.test.ts` (test skipped due to flattened outline), moved `ClassDefinitionIndexer.test.ts` to `server/src/test/env/` (excluded from CI; requires Clarion 11.1 installed). Rescued the one passing `UnlabeledGroupNesting` test into `DocumentSymbolProvider.test.ts`. Fixed cross-test `SolutionManager` singleton dependency in `EquatesScope.test.ts`. Fixed `DocumentHighlightProvider` tests: Clarion labels must be at column 0 to be tokenised as `Label` tokens. Suite now runs at **747 passing, 0 pending, 0 failing**.

### [0.9.1] - 2026-04-14

**Infrastructure**

- 🚀 **Bundle extension with esbuild** ([#56](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/56)) — VSIX drops from ~786 files / 2.5 MB to **30 files / 615 KB**:
  - `esbuild.mjs` bundles client and server into two single-file outputs; only `vscode` remains external
  - 4 data services (`BuiltinFunctionService`, `AttributeService`, `DataTypeService`, `ControlService`) now use static JSON imports instead of `fs.readFileSync` — esbuild inlines the data at bundle time
  - `node_modules/**` excluded from VSIX at root, `client/`, and `server/` — all runtime deps are bundled in
  - Dev workflow (`compile:dev`) is unchanged; only `vscode:prepublish` uses esbuild
- 🔧 **Update GitHub Actions to Node.js 24 compatible versions** ([#57](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/57)) — `actions/checkout@v5`, `actions/setup-node@v5`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4.6.2`
- 🔧 **Add `testrelease.yml` dry-run workflow** — runs the full build/test/package pipeline without merging or publishing; uploads the VSIX as a downloadable artifact for pre-release verification

---

### [0.9.0] - 2026-04-14

**New Features**

- ✨ **Dot-triggered member completion for CLASS instances and `SELF`** ([#54](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/54)) — typing `SELF.` or `MyVar.` now opens a dropdown of all methods and properties on the resolved class:
  - `SELF.` resolves to the enclosing class via `ChainedPropertyResolver`
  - `PARENT.` resolves to the base class
  - `MyVar.` resolves the variable's declared type then enumerates members
  - `ClassName.` enumerates the class directly
  - Full inheritance walk — child members shadow parent members by name
  - `PRIVATE` members visible only within the same class; `PROTECTED` visible in subclasses; `PUBLIC` visible everywhere
  - Chained expressions (`SELF.Order.`) resolve intermediate segment types
  - Each overloaded method appears as a distinct entry (e.g. `AddItem(STRING pText)` and `AddItem(LONG pId, STRING pText)`) with return type shown in the detail column

- ✨ **Signature help for class methods** ([#54](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/54)) — typing `(` after selecting a method from dot-completion (or typing `SELF.Method(` manually) now shows parameter hints; inherits the full inheritance chain so methods from parent classes are found correctly

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **Hover for equates/labels in `INCLUDE` files and `EQUATES.CLW`** — symbols defined in files pulled in via `INCLUDE` statements at the global level (e.g. `KEYCODES.CLW`, `EQUATES.CLW`) now resolve correctly on hover; previously the lookup stopped at the current file
- 🐛 **Hover for equates inside `PROCEDURE` scope** — the INCLUDE chain is now also checked when the cursor is inside a procedure body; the resolver now walks global → module → procedure scope then falls back to all includes in the chain
- 🐛 **Hover for methods on typed variables declared in a parent/include file** — `UD.ShowProcedureInfo` where `UD CLASS(UltimateDebug)` is declared in a parent `.clw` (referenced via `MEMBER`) now shows the correct hover card; the variable type resolver now searches the MEMBER parent when the variable is not found in the current file
- 🐛 **Go to Declaration (F12) for methods on typed variables in parent/include files** — `DefinitionProvider.findClassMemberInIncludes` had the same nested-`END` bug as hover: the raw-text class member scan would exit on the first `END` encountered (e.g. the end of a nested `GROUP`/`QUEUE`/`RECORD`) rather than the end of the `CLASS` block; fixed with `nestDepth` tracking
- 🐛 **Go to Implementation (Ctrl+F12) for typed variables declared in parent/include files** — `ImplementationProvider` only searched the current file for the variable type; a new `findVariableTypeCrossFile()` method now mirrors hover's cross-file lookup (current file → MEMBER parent via `crossFileCache`) so `UD.ShowProcedureInfo` etc. resolve correctly
- 🐛 **`ClassMemberResolver.searchFileForMember` nested-`END` fix** — the shared member-scan utility (used by both hover fallback and GoTo) now tracks `nestDepth` so nested structure blocks inside a `CLASS` do not prematurely terminate the scan

**Refactoring**

- ♻️ **`MemberLocatorService` — unified dot-access resolution** — extracted a single service (`server/src/services/MemberLocatorService.ts`) that owns the entire typed-variable dot-access lookup pipeline (variable type resolution → INCLUDE chain walk → class index lookup → parent class chain). Hover, F12, and Ctrl+F12 all now delegate to this service, eliminating three independent implementations that previously diverged and caused repeated provider-specific bugs (see issue #50)
  - `DefinitionProvider.findClassMemberInIncludes` (raw-text fallback) deleted — replaced by service
  - `DefinitionProvider.findMemberInIncludes` (tokenized walk) deleted — replaced by service
  - `ImplementationProvider.findVariableTypeCrossFile` deleted — replaced by service
  - `ImplementationProvider.findVariableType` deleted — replaced by service
  - `VariableHoverResolver.findVariableTokenCrossFile`, `findGlobalVariableInParentFile`, `searchIncludesForLabel`, `resolveFilePath` deleted — hover now fully delegates cross-file variable lookup to `MemberLocatorService`, completing the unification between hover and GoTo code paths

**Bug Fixes (regression — v0.9.0)**

- 🐛 **Find All References returns only 1 result for MAP procedure calls**
- 🐛 **Find All References for module-scoped symbols incorrectly expanded to all project files** — symbols declared at module level in a MEMBER file (before the first PROCEDURE, per Clarion scope rules) have module scope and are only visible within that MEMBER module. `ReferencesProvider.getFilesToSearch` was falling through to global (all-project) search for any module-scoped symbol in a MEMBER file; it now correctly returns only the declaring file for MEMBER-file module-scoped symbols
- 🐛 **Hover / F12 for procedure-local variables when cursor is inside a ROUTINE** — variables declared in a procedure's local data section (between `PROCEDURE` and `CODE`) are accessible from all `ROUTINE` blocks within that procedure per Clarion scope rules, but `SymbolFinderService.findLocalVariable` only searched within the ROUTINE's own range and never checked the parent procedure's data section. The fix: (1) after the ROUTINE's own search fails, the parent procedure is located via `TokenHelper.getParentScopeOfRoutine` and its data section (before the CODE marker) is scanned for the variable; (2) when the symbol-tree path finds the variable in the parent procedure's data, the returned scope token is now the parent procedure (not the ROUTINE) so FAR searches the entire procedure range instead of just the ROUTINE
- 🐛 **F12 broken for variables declared in a MEMBER parent's INCLUDE chain**— `DefinitionProvider`'s MEMBER parent fallback only read the parent CLW directly and never walked its INCLUDE chain; added `findVariableInParentChain()` to `MemberLocatorService` and replaced the ~60-line manual fallback with a 5-line delegation
- 🐛 **F12 broken for dot-access where the object variable is declared cross-file** — both dot-access entry points in `DefinitionProvider` called `findVariableType()` (current-file only) for step 1 (type resolution); they now first try `memberLocator.resolveVariableType()` (cross-file) and fall back to `findVariableType()` only for non-class types, matching hover's behaviour
- 🐛 **Signature help (`Ctrl+Shift+Space`) missing for methods on cross-file variables** — `SignatureHelpProvider` used its own current-file-only variable type resolver; it now uses `MemberLocatorService.resolveVariableType()` so parameter hints appear for `st.Method()` where `st` is declared in a MEMBER parent or INCLUDE file, consistent with hover and F12
- 🐛 **Signature help missing for `SELF.Method(` when class is defined in the same `.clw` file** — `SignatureHelpProvider.getClassMethodSignatures` used a local token scan that missed classes defined in the current file and never walked the inheritance chain; it now delegates to `MemberLocatorService.enumerateMembersInClass` which handles all cases including inherited methods ([#54](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/54))
- 🐛 **Missing `END` not flagged for window sub-structures** — `DiagnosticProvider.requiresTerminator` only covered data/code structures; `WINDOW`, `REPORT`, `APPLICATION`, `SHEET`, `TAB`, `OLE`, `OPTION`, `MENU`, `MENUBAR`, and `TOOLBAR` now also produce a diagnostic when their closing `END` is absent ([#55](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/55))
