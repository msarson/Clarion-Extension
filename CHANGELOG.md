## Recent Versions

### [0.9.7] - Unreleased

**New Features**

- ✨ **Find All References / Rename scope isolation for local MAP procedures** (issue #91/#95): Find All References and Rename Symbol now correctly restrict their search to files reachable via the same procedure-local MAP scope. Previously, two procedures in different local MAPs sharing a name would be incorrectly merged into a single reference set. Hover on a local-MAP procedure call in a MEMBER file is also scoped correctly to the right MAP block.
- ✨ **Save before build** (issue #88): a new `clarion.saveBeforeBuild` setting (boolean, default `true`) automatically saves all unsaved open files before any build is triggered — solution build, project build, dependency-ordered build, generate-and-build, etc. Disable it to keep the old behaviour of building without saving.
- ✨ **Diagnostic: procedure missing MAP declaration** (issue #89): in MEMBER files, a Warning diagnostic is raised on any `GlobalProcedure` implementation that has no matching declaration inside a `MAP/MODULE` block in the parent PROGRAM file. Helps hand-coders catch forgotten MAP entries before a full build. Method implementations (`MyClass.Method PROCEDURE`) are excluded as their declarations live in CLASS blocks.
- ✨ **F5 — Launch Clarion Debugger**:pressing F5 (when a solution is open) launches `CladbNE.exe` (the non-elevation Clarion debugger) against the startup project's executable. The debugger path is derived automatically from the Clarion bin folder already known to the extension — no extra settings required. A prompt offers to build the project first (using the current configuration, awaited to completion before launching). A warning is shown if the active build configuration is not a Debug variant, since source files will not be available in the debugger for Release builds.
- ✨ **Ctrl+F5 — Build prompt before run**: running without debugging now prompts "Build and Run / Run Without Building / Cancel" before launching the executable, matching VS Code's standard pre-launch behaviour.
- ✨ **Clarion IDE preferences sync**: on solution open, the extension now reads the Clarion IDE's preferences XML (`%AppData%\SoftVelocity\Clarion\<version>\preferences\<sln>.<hash>.xml`) and automatically applies the IDE's active startup project and build configuration to VS Code. Changes made in VS Code (switching configuration or setting the startup project) are written back to the same file so the Clarion IDE always reflects the current state. When creating a new solution the preferences XML is created automatically.
- ✨ **Clarion Actions toolbar**: a new **Actions** panel in the Explorer sidebar provides quick-access icon buttons for Build, Run (Ctrl+F5), Debug (F5), Open Solution, and Close Solution. Below the buttons, a summary table shows the current solution name, startup project, and active build configuration. The summary updates automatically when the configuration is changed from the status bar.
- ✨ **Add MODULE with PROCEDURE code action** (issue #87): pressing `Ctrl+.` inside a MAP block now offers **Add MODULE with PROCEDURE**. A prompt collects the new CLW filename and procedure name. A QuickPick lists every directory from the project's redirection file where CLW files may live (labelled by section — `[Project]`, `[DEBUG]`, `[RELEASE]`, `[COMMON]`, etc.); the picker is skipped when only one candidate exists. The selected directory receives the new CLW stub (CRLF, correct `MEMBER` reference, `MAP/END`, and `PROCEDURE` body). The MODULE block is inserted into the MAP, the file is registered in `.cwproj`, the solution is refreshed, and the new file is opened. When triggered from a **local MAP** (inside a procedure), the generated CLW additionally declares the procedure inside its own `MAP/END` block, as Clarion requires for local-map modules.
- ✨ **Quick-fix code actions for MAP diagnostics** (issue #90): pressing `Ctrl+.` on any MAP declaration/implementation diagnostic now offers targeted quick fixes:
  - **Missing MAP declaration** (MEMBER file): "Add declaration to MAP in `Program.clw`" — inserts `ProcName PROCEDURE(params)` into the correct MODULE block, or creates a new MODULE block if none references the file.
  - **Missing implementation** (PROGRAM file): "Add implementation to `File.clw`" — appends a `ProcName PROCEDURE(params)\nCODE\nRETURN` stub at the end of the CLW.
  - **Signature mismatch** (either side): two actions — "Update declaration to match implementation" and "Update implementation to match declaration". The `(params)` list is replaced precisely; any return type or attributes after `)` in the MAP declaration are always preserved.
- ✨ **Add PROCEDURE code action from MAP** (issue #87): pressing `Ctrl+.` inside a MAP block (but outside any MODULE) also offers **Add PROCEDURE** targeting the current file — inserts the prototype directly in the MAP and appends the implementation to the end of the file.
- ✨ **`clarion.procedurePrototypeStyle` setting** (issue #87): controls the prototype form used when inserting declarations into MAP/MODULE structures. `"keyword"` (default, docs-recommended): `ProcName PROCEDURE()`. `"shorthand"` (backward-compat): `ProcName()` with correct indentation (1 level inside MAP, 2 levels inside MODULE). The procedure implementation body always uses the full keyword form.
- ✨ **MAP diagnostics for local and self-declared MODULE scopes** (issue #91): signature-mismatch diagnostics now fire for procedure-level MAP declarations (bare MAP inside a procedure body) and for self-declaration `MODULE('thisfile.clw')` blocks. `validateMissingImplementations` now also runs on MEMBER files so MODULE blocks in any source file are checked, not just PROGRAM files.
- ✨ **Multi-file "update all declarations" quick-fix** (issue #91): when a signature mismatch is fixed via `Ctrl+.`, the quick-fix now updates **all** files that declare the procedure (via `FileRelationshipGraph.getModuleDeclarants`). The action title shows "(N files)" when multiple files are affected. The SV AppGen pattern where `MODULE` blocks live in a shared `.inc` file is handled correctly.
- ✨ **Warn on non-Windows-1252 characters** (issue #82): any character with code point > 0xFF in `.clw`, `.inc`, `.equ`, or `.int` files raises a **Warning** diagnostic (`invalid-encoding`). Characters ≤ 0xFF (full Windows-1252 range including accented Latin characters) are not flagged. A `Ctrl+.` quick-fix offers to replace known Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents (smart quotes → straight quotes, em/en dash → hyphen, etc.) or delete the character. A **"Fix all N invalid characters"** bulk action appears when multiple issues exist in the file.
- ✨ **Context-aware attribute completions and diagnostics** (issue #80): word completions inside a control or structure declaration are now filtered by the surrounding context — e.g. typing inside a `BUTTON(...)` only suggests attributes valid for `BUTTON` plus generic `CONTROL` attributes, rather than the full attribute list. A new `invalid-attribute-context` Warning diagnostic fires when an attribute is used on a control type that doesn't support it (uses `applicableTo` metadata in `clarion-attributes.json`). Validation only runs on unambiguous window/report controls (BUTTON, ENTRY, LIST, COMBO, CHECK, RADIO, IMAGE, LINE, BOX, ELLIPSE, PANEL, PROGRESS, REGION, PROMPT, SPIN, ITEM, TEXT) — dual-role keywords like GROUP/QUEUE/SHEET/TAB/MENU/MENUBAR/TOOLBAR/OLE/OPTION are intentionally skipped because their attribute set depends on whether they're being used as data structures or window controls, which can't always be inferred from token context.

**Hover Improvements**

- 🎨 **Standardised hover location format**: all hover tooltips (procedures, methods, variables, structure types, fields, class declarations) now display the source location as `filename:N` placed at the bottom of the tooltip, after the code block — consistent across every hover type.
- 🐛 **CLASS type header no longer picks up `Link()`/`DLL()` arguments**: `CLASS(), Link('x', SomeName)` was incorrectly shown as `CLASS(SomeName)` in the hover header. The type extractor now only looks inside the first `(…)` group of the structure keyword.

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **Stale MAP-diagnostic race condition after code-action fix**: applying a "sync signature" quick fix via `Ctrl+.` could leave the mismatch diagnostic visible until the files were saved or the extension restarted. Root cause: `CrossFileResolver` cached parent-file content under an un-encoded URI (`file:///f:/…`); VS Code's live buffer stored the updated content under a percent-encoded URI (`file:///f%3A/…`). Cross-file re-validation found the stale un-encoded entry first. Fix: after the TokenCache is refreshed on `onDidChangeContent`, any duplicate cache entries that normalise to the same path but use a different URI format are now removed — ensuring only the fresh VS Code buffer content is used.
- 🐛 **Ctrl+P (Quick Open) now includes files from redirection paths**:relative paths in `.red` redirection files are now resolved relative to the `.red` file's own directory rather than the project directory, so files in accessory `libsrc` and other Clarion-managed source trees appear correctly in the quick-open file list.
- 🐛 **Auto-restore solution after cross-folder workspace switch**: opening a solution from the Solution View history that lives in a different folder now correctly restores all settings (properties file, version, configuration) on the subsequent activation, eliminating the "Clarion settings are incomplete" warning.
- 🐛 **GlobalSolutionHistory saves full settings on all paths**: history entries now always include `propertiesFile`, `version`, and `configuration` regardless of which code path triggered the save, so cross-folder restore has the information it needs.
- 🐛 **Blank `currentSolution` no longer prevents solution load**: when `clarion.currentSolution` is empty but `clarion.solutions` contains entries (e.g. after closing a solution), the extension now falls back to the first solutions array entry so the solution loads correctly on next activation.

---

### [0.9.6] - 2026-04-23

**New Features**

- ✨ **New Solution wizard** (issue #79): create a minimal Clarion solution (`.sln`, `.cwproj`, `.clw`) from the Solution view `+` button or the command palette (`Clarion: New Solution`). Prompts for solution name and auto-detects the installed Clarion version and configuration.
- ✨ **Stale solution cleanup**: if a solution referenced in workspace settings no longer exists on disk, it is silently removed from settings on startup rather than leaving the extension in a broken state.
- ✨ **Missing Link/DLL equates code action** (issue #81): pressing `Ctrl+.` on a class name or its `INCLUDE` line now offers to add any missing `Link()`/`DLL()` equates to the project's `DefineConstants` in the `.cwproj` file. A QuickPick prompt lets you choose between static-link mode (`LinkMode=>1, DllMode=>0`) and DLL mode (`LinkMode=>0, DllMode=>1`), covering both single-exe and multi-DLL application setups.
- ✨ **Missing INCLUDE diagnostic & code action** (issue #83): variables declared with a user-defined class type (e.g. `st StringTheory` or `af &FileManager`) now show a **Warning** squiggle when the type's `.inc` file is not included in the current file or its `MEMBER` parent. A code action (`Ctrl+.`) offers to insert the `INCLUDE('…'),ONCE` statement in the current file or the MEMBER parent, and a combined action adds both the INCLUDE and any missing project constants in one step. When both the include and constants are absent, the warning message lists the missing constants upfront.
- ✨ **Missing DefineConstants diagnostic** (issue #83): when a class `.inc` is included but its required `Link()`/`DLL()` equates are not yet defined in the `.cwproj`, an **Information** diagnostic is shown on the type declaration. A code action offers to add the missing constants directly from the squiggle. The diagnostic clears immediately after constants are added — the extension watches the `.cwproj` file for any external changes too.

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **Find All References / Rename Symbol**: procedure-scope local variables and parameters are now found inside locally-derived class method bodies (issue #78).Clarion's language spec states that methods prototyped in a CLASS declared within a procedure's local data section share the declaring procedure's full local scope. Previously, `finishesAt` (set for folding) was also used as a hard scope boundary, cutting off any method implementations that appear after the parent procedure's data section. The fix extends the search to include all method implementation bodies whose class name matches a locally-declared class in the scope procedure's data section, guarded against cross-file contamination by requiring no intervening global procedure between the scope boundary and the implementation.
- 🐛 Variable hover no longer appends a spurious "EQUATE Definition" block from the structure index — `enhanceHoverWithClassInfo` now only enriches hover when the variable's type resolves to a `CLASS` or `INTERFACE` in the index; primitive type names such as `LONG` that happen to match an equate in a library file (e.g. `ABUTIL.INC`) are no longer shown
- 🐛 Commented-out `INCLUDE` statements (e.g. `!INCLUDE('StringTheory.inc')`) are no longer treated as active includes by the missing-include diagnostic.
- 🐛 False-positive missing-include / missing-constants diagnostics on built-in type names (issue #85): The structure declaration indexer now correctly handles blank-label `ITEMIZE` blocks (e.g. `ITEMIZE,PRE(CLType)` with no label at column 0, as found in `XMLType.inc` and similar library files). Previously such entries were indexed as bare standalone equates (`BYTE`, `SHORT`, `REAL`, etc.), causing spurious warnings. They are now indexed with the correct PRE-prefixed names (`CLType:BYTE`, etc.) and — equally important — the missing-include and missing-constants validators now only fire on `CLASS` and `INTERFACE` definitions, ignoring EQUATE/ITEMIZE entries from the index.
- 🐛 False-positive `BREAK used outside LOOP` diagnostics (issue #86): The Clarion equate idiom `token:function` was incorrectly matching the `/\bFUNCTION\b/i` pattern (`:` is a non-word character, so `\b` fired between `:` and `f`). This reset `inCodeSection` to `false` mid-method, causing the tokenizer to silently skip `IF`/`CASE` structures, which in turn made `BREAK`/`CYCLE` diagnostics fire outside their containing loop.
- 🐛 False-positive missing-include diagnostics for transitively-included types: the include verifier previously only checked direct `INCLUDE` statements of the current file and its `MEMBER` parent. Types defined in files included transitively (e.g. `FileA.clw → FileA.Inc → DriverClass.Inc`) were incorrectly flagged. The verifier now performs a full BFS walk of the include graph (any depth, cycle-safe) from both the current file and the MEMBER parent.

### [0.9.5] - 2026-04-21

**Hover Documentation — Major Expansion (310 built-ins, 158 attributes)**

- ✨ Hover documentation for Clarion compiler directives: `ITEMIZE`, `SECTION` (new); existing `ASSERT`, `BEGIN`, `COMPILE`, `EQUATE`, `INCLUDE`, `OMIT`, `SIZE` already covered
- ✨ Builtin hover now narrows overloads by first-argument type — e.g. hovering `OPEN(Window)` shows only the `WINDOW` overloads, not all 8 signatures; labels are enriched with `structureType` (FILE, VIEW, WINDOW, REPORT, etc.) during document processing (#74)

**Solution & Build Integration**

- ✨ Projects now sorted by build order (dependency-first) in the Solution View
- ✨ Active build configuration auto-detected from `.sln.cache` on solution open — no longer defaults to the first config in the list
- 🐛 Fixed MSBuild integration: correct `Platform` property quoting, skip `Platform=Any CPU` for native projects, per-project log files, Clarion native error format detection
- 🐛 Fixed duplicate cwproj GUIDs causing `ProjectDependencyResolver` to fail silently
- 🐛 Fixed missing completion message at end of dependency analysis

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **SDI startup crash (EISDIR)** — the StructureDeclarationIndexer (SDI) was attempting to read the project directory as a file when the redirection file setting was not yet configured (before solution load), causing an `EISDIR` error and an empty declaration index. Three-layer fix: (1) bail early in the redirection parser when `redirectionFile` is empty; (2) return an uncached empty index from `getOrBuildIndex` to prevent cache pollution; (3) clear the SDI cache when the solution sends the `redirectionFile` path via `clarion/updatePaths`. This resolves hover and Go To Definition failures for symbols from INCLUDE files on first open.
- 🐛 `LIKE(TypeName)` dot-access chains now resolve correctly in hover and Go To Definition — e.g. `SELF.OrigWin.Maximized` where `OrigWin` is declared `LIKE(WindowPositionGroup)` now navigates to the `Maximized` field in the GROUP; colon-qualified names such as `LIKE(PYA:RECORD)` are also supported (closes #76)
- 🐛 Equate hover no longer shows `UNKNOWN` as the type (e.g. `Resize:LockWidth EQUATE(00000001b)` now shows `EQUATE` correctly)
- 🐛 Equate hover now correctly shows `EQUATE` type for equates declared with a space before the parenthesis (e.g. `CREATE:combo EQUATE (15)`)
- 🐛 Equate hover now shows "Global constant" / "Module constant" instead of "Global variable" for `EQUATE` declarations
- 🐛 Shorthand MAP/MODULE parameter types no longer mistaken for the procedure return type
- 🐛 `KEY` used as a parameter type in MAP/MODULE declarations no longer appears in the outline view
- 🐛 `DLL` and `LINK` attribute flags now accept any user-defined compilation symbol (not just a hardcoded set)
- 🐛 Removed directive hover entries that duplicated built-in hover coverage
- 🐛 Removed duplicate `VAL` built-in and merged duplicate `AUTO` attribute entries

---

### [0.9.4] - 2026-04-19

### [0.9.3] - 2026-04-19

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **Fix diagnostics flashing then disappearing on file open** — Discarded-return-value warnings were emitted immediately on `onDidOpen` (107 warnings in test cases) then cleared to zero ~30ms later when `solutionReady` re-validated the same document. Root cause: `DocumentStructure.process()` was being called **twice** on the same token array — once inside `ClarionTokenizer.tokenize()` and once in `TokenCache.getTokens()`. Because `process()` mutates tokens in-place and is not idempotent, the second pass corrupted `MapProcedure` subType assignments (count ballooned from 21 → 178 in affected files), which caused the deduplication logic in `validateDiscardedReturnValuesForPlainCalls` to move all procedures into the `excluded` set → 0 diagnostics. Fixed by: (1) storing the `DocumentStructure` instance created inside `ClarionTokenizer.processDocumentStructure()` and exposing it via `getDocumentStructure()`; (2) having `TokenCache.getTokens()` reuse that instance instead of constructing a new one and calling `process()` again; (3) skipping `processDocumentStructure()` on the partial-line tokenizer used in the incremental update path (the final merged-token `DocumentStructure.process()` is the single authoritative pass). Also fixed `DocumentStructure.buildParentIndex()` which was called in the constructor before `process()` had set `finishesAt` and `subType` values — it is now rebuilt at the end of `process()` using the fully populated token data.

**Tokenizer & Outline**

- 🐛 **Fix WINDOW (and other structure keywords) used as labels in the outline** ([#68](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/68)) — the Clarion language spec explicitly allows `WINDOW`, `CLASS`, `FILE`, `GROUP`, `QUEUE`, `VIEW`, `RECORD`, `MAP`, `MODULE`, `INTERFACE`, and `REPORT` to be used as data-structure labels. The tokenizer's Label pattern was incorrectly excluding all of these keywords via a negative lookahead, so a line like `Window  WINDOW('Caption'),...` caused `W` to be silently skipped and `indow` to be produced as a spurious Variable token. This left the WINDOW structure with no label, resulting in two outline entries instead of one. Fixed by removing all structure keywords from the Label exclusion list (keeping only the truly reserved words: `COMPILE`, `OMIT`, `EMBED`, `SECTION`, `ENDSECTION`, `INCLUDE`, `PROGRAM`, `MEMBER`, `END`). The `PatternMatcher` `lower` charClass was also missing `TokenType.Label`, meaning lowercase-starting labels such as `window` were never matched as labels; this has been corrected.

**Formatter**

- 🔧 **Fix document formatter — 6 bugs resolved** ([#66](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/66)):
  - 🐛 Procedures and routines were not being detected correctly due to a wrong `subType` check, causing local data sections and execution ranges to be misidentified.
  - 🐛 Single-line structures (open and close on the same line) were indented using a hardcoded minimum instead of the current indent stack level.
  - 🐛 Formatted output always used CRLF regardless of the source file's line endings; the formatter now preserves the original EOL style.
  - 🐛 Dot-notation method implementations (e.g. `ThisWindow.Init PROCEDURE`) lost the dot — the formatter emitted `ThisWindow  Init PROCEDURE`. The full label text including dot is now preserved.
  - 🐛 `CLASS`/`GROUP`/`QUEUE` declarations inside a procedure's local data section were treated as flat variables. This caused the structure body (`END` and member declarations) to use incorrect indentation. Structures now push to the indent stack even inside local data sections.
  - 🐛 Within a `CLASS` body, each method's `PROCEDURE` keyword was aligned independently per label length, producing ragged columns. All method keywords now align to a single shared column determined by the longest method label in the class.
  - 🐛 `CLASS` keyword column in a local data section did not match the type-keyword column of surrounding variable declarations. It now uses the same `snap0(maxLabel+1)` formula as all other local data lines.

**Diagnostics**

- 🐛 **Diagnose reserved keywords used as labels** ([#69](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/69)) — the Clarion language spec defines two categories of reserved words. *Fully reserved* keywords (`RETURN`, `WHILE`, `CYCLE`, `GOTO`, `PROCEDURE`, etc.) may never be used as labels. *Structure-only* keywords (`WINDOW`, `CLASS`, `QUEUE`, etc.) may label data structures but not `PROCEDURE` or `FUNCTION` declarations. The new `LabelDiagnostics` validator flags both violations as errors. Matching is case-insensitive (Clarion is case-insensitive). Valid uses — such as `WINDOW` labelling a `WINDOW` structure, or `CLASS` labelling a `CLASS` structure — are not flagged.

**Code Actions**

- ✨ **Flatten continuation lines** (`Ctrl+.` → "Flatten continuation lines") ([#70](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/70)) — Clarion uses `|` at end-of-line to continue long expressions across multiple source lines. A new Code Action appears (via the lightbulb or `Ctrl+.`) whenever the cursor is on a line that is part of a `|` continuation group. Activating it joins the group into a single line, trimming leading whitespace from continuation lines and collapsing adjacent string literals joined by `&` (e.g. `'abc' & 'def'` → `'abcdef'`). When a selection spanning multiple lines is active, only the selected lines are flattened; otherwise the full continuation group around the cursor is found automatically. The `|` detection is string-safe: a pipe character inside a Clarion string literal (including strings with `''` escaped quotes) is never treated as a continuation marker.

**Editor Navigation**

- ✨ **Expand Selection through structure nesting** (`Shift+Alt+→` / `Shift+Alt+←`) ([#71](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/71)) — the extension now implements the LSP `SelectionRangeProvider`. Pressing **Shift+Alt+→** progressively widens the selection through Clarion's scope hierarchy: current token → current line → innermost containing structure/procedure/routine → parent structure → … → whole document. **Shift+Alt+←** shrinks back through the same chain. Works for all container types: `PROCEDURE`, `ROUTINE`, `CLASS`, `WINDOW`, `QUEUE`, `GROUP`, `RECORD`, `FILE`, `VIEW`, `REPORT`, etc.

- ✨ **CodeLens: inline reference counts above procedures** ([#72](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/72)) — the editor now shows `N references` (or `1 reference`) inline above each procedure and CLASS declaration, similar to TypeScript/C# support in VS Code. The count is computed lazily (resolve phase) so it only runs for lenses visible in the viewport, not the whole file at once. Clicking the lens opens the standard References panel at that symbol. Shows `0 references` too — useful for spotting dead code.

- 🐛 **Fix false-positive "unreachable code" after multiple sequential `IF..RETURN..END` blocks** ([#67](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/67))— when a string literal in a Trace call (e.g. `Trace('...function pointers...')`) appeared on a line before the second `IF`, the tokenizer matched the word `function` inside the string and incorrectly reset `inCodeSection = false`. This caused the second `IF` to be skipped as an "execution structure before CODE", leaving `UnreachableCodeProvider` with no stack entry for it. Any subsequent `RETURN` inside that block then appeared at procedure level, causing all code after the `IF..END` to be flagged as unreachable. Fixed by stripping string literals (and comments) from the line before checking for `PROCEDURE`/`FUNCTION` keywords.

- ⚠️ **Warn on discarded plain MAP/MODULE procedure return values**([#51](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/51)) — a new warning fires when a plain (non-dot-access) call to a MAP or MODULE procedure that returns a value is used as a statement without capturing the result. Covers procedures declared directly in a `MAP` block, inside a `MODULE(...)` within a MAP, and in local procedure MAPs. Cross-file detection is supported: procedures declared in a global MAP in the program file (or any other cached file) are also checked when called from a MEMBER file. Add the `PROC` attribute to the declaration, or assign the return value, to suppress the warning.
- ⚠️ **Warn on BREAK/CYCLE outside LOOP or ACCEPT** ([#64](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/64)) — a new warning fires when `BREAK` or `CYCLE` appears outside any `LOOP` or `ACCEPT` structure. Both constructs are valid anywhere inside a `LOOP` or `ACCEPT` block (including nested blocks). Labeled forms (`BREAK Label` / `CYCLE Label`) are excluded from this check as they are addressed separately in issue #65.

**Code Quality**

- 🔧 **Refactor DiagnosticProvider into focused sub-modules** — the 1943-line `DiagnosticProvider.ts` has been split into four focused helper modules in `server/src/providers/diagnostics/`: `StructureDiagnostics.ts`, `ClassDiagnostics.ts`, `ReturnValueDiagnostics.ts`, and `ControlFlowDiagnostics.ts`. `DiagnosticProvider` is now a thin facade that delegates to these modules, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

- ✨ **Hover documentation for `PROP:` and `PROPPRINT:` runtime properties** ([#73](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/73)) — hovering over any Clarion runtime property equate now shows documentation sourced from the Clarion 11.1 Language Reference. Covers 336 `PROP:` entries (window/control/file/system properties) and 25 `PROPPRINT:` printer control properties (`PROPPRINT:Device`, `PROPPRINT:Copies`, `PROPPRINT:Paper`, etc.). Read-only properties are labelled accordingly. `PROPPRINT:` hovers show a printer-appropriate usage example (`PRINTER{PROPPRINT:Device}`). Works wherever property equates appear in code.
- ✨ **Hover and autocomplete for `EVENT:` equates** ([#74](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/74)) — hovering over any Clarion event equate (e.g. `EVENT:Accepted`, `EVENT:CloseWindow`, `EVENT:Timer`) now shows a description, category (Field-Specific / Field-Independent / DDE), and a usage example. Autocomplete fires when typing `EVENT:` (or after the colon), listing all 62 event equates with category and description in the detail column. DDE events are included.

### [0.9.2] - 2026-04-18

**Performance Fixes**

- 🚀 **Replace `ClassDefinitionIndexer` with `StructureDeclarationIndexer`** — the legacy `ClassDefinitionIndexer` only covered CLASS/QUEUE/GROUP and used a per-file sequential scan. The new `StructureDeclarationIndexer` covers CLASS, INTERFACE, QUEUE, GROUP, RECORD, FILE, VIEW, EQUATE, and ITEMIZE equates; stores 0-based line numbers canonically; and exposes a simpler API (`find`, `findInFile`, `getOrBuildIndex`). All 8 callers (MemberLocatorService, ClassMemberResolver, HoverProvider, MethodHoverResolver, VariableHoverResolver, ClassConstantsCodeActionProvider, ReferencesProvider, DefinitionProvider) have been migrated to use the new indexer directly, and the legacy class has been deleted.

**Diagnostics**

- ⚠️ **Warn on discarded method return values** ([#61](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/61)) — a new warning diagnostic fires when a dot-access method call that returns a value (and lacks the `PROC` attribute) is used as a statement with no capture. Reuses the same cross-file type resolution path as hover and F12 so results stay consistent. The async resolution pass is re-triggered after the solution finishes loading so files opened before the solution is ready are still validated. `SELF`/`PARENT` calls inside class method implementations are resolved via the implementation label. Assignments (`obj.Field = value`) and chained expressions are correctly excluded.

**Performance Fixes**

- 🚀 **Eliminate unnecessary disk reads in hot paths** ([#59](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/59)) — replaced `readFileSync` + O(n²) scans with token cache lookups across three providers:
  - `VariableHoverResolver`: O(n²) backward scan to find enclosing CLASS replaced with `DocumentStructure.getClasses()` range check (O(n) → O(k) where k = class count)
  - `SymbolFinderService.extractTypeInfo`: three sequential O(n) `filter/indexOf` passes collapsed into a single `lineTokens` build
  - `MemberLocatorService`: full token-based `findMemberFromTokens` / `extractMembersFromTokens` fast-path; disk-based fallback retained for uncached files
  - `ImplementationProvider.searchFileForMethodImplementation`: checks token cache first; single-candidate case returns without any disk read
  - `DefinitionProvider` equates fallback: skips `readFileSync` when equates.clw is already in the token cache
- 🐛 **Fix token cache overwrite in `MemberLocatorService`** — synthetic `TextDocument(version=1)` objects used for cross-file lookups no longer overwrite live editor tokens; providers now use `getTokensByUri` first and only fall back to `getTokens` for uncached files
- 🚀 **Structure/outline view no longer freezes during rapid undo** — added a `maxWait` of 1500ms to the document-change debounce so the structure tree always refreshes within 1.5 s even when the user holds Ctrl+Z continuously (previously the 500 ms rolling debounce reset on every undo step, starving the refresh indefinitely)
- 🚀 **Parallelize CLASS index build** — `ClassDefinitionIndexer.buildIndex` now scans all `.inc` files concurrently (`Promise.all`) instead of one-at-a-time; on large installations with hundreds of libsrc files this is 10–100× faster. Added always-on timing logs so build duration is visible in the Output channel.
- 🚀 **Eliminate hover/F12 hang on cursor movement** — `DocumentHighlightProvider` (occurrence highlighting, triggered by VS Code on every cursor move) was calling `ReferencesProvider.provideReferences()` which performed a full cross-file scan of all project source files then discarded every result outside the current file. On a 40-project solution this blocked the LSP event loop for 3–8 seconds on every cursor movement, preventing hover and F12 from running. `DocumentHighlightProvider` has been rewritten with a fast local token-cache scan (O(n) over current file tokens, synchronous, <1ms).
- ✨ **Client logs routed to VS Code Output channel** — log messages from the extension client side are now written to a `"Clarion Extension (Client)"` output channel in VS Code, making client-side diagnostics visible without needing a separate developer tools console.

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **F12 now works for procedure parameters** — pressing F12 on a parameter name inside a procedure body (or inside a local class method body that can access the outer procedure's parameters) now navigates to the parameter declaration in the `PROCEDURE()` signature. Previously `DefinitionProvider` only searched column-0 labels and never found parameters. `DefinitionProvider` now delegates to `SymbolFinderService.findParameter` — the same code path already used by hover — so both providers share one source of truth for parameter resolution.
- 🔧 **Share type-definition SDI lookup between hover and F12** — `SymbolFinderService.findIndexedTypeDeclaration()` is now the single source of truth for looking up named types (CLASS, INTERFACE, QUEUE, GROUP, etc.) via the `StructureDeclarationIndexer`. Both `HoverProvider._checkClassTypeHoverInternal` and `DefinitionProvider.findClassTypeDefinition` delegate to this shared method; the hover-only include-verification guard (`IncludeVerifier.isClassIncluded`) remains exclusively in `HoverProvider`, so F12 navigation behaviour is unchanged.
- 🐛 **Hover: show both declaration and implementation for inherited class methods**— `SELF.Method()` hover on methods inherited from a parent class defined in an `.inc` file (e.g. `WindowManager.SetAlerts` from `ABWINDOW.INC`) was only showing the declaration. The fix reads the `MODULE('...')` attribute from the class definition to locate the correct `.clw` implementation file via redirection, rather than guessing from the `.inc` filename. Local classes (declared in `.clw`) are unaffected.
- 🐛 **Hover for `LOC:`-prefixed procedure parameters** ([#60](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/60)) — hovering over `LOC:Test` inside a procedure body where the parameter is declared as `PROCEDURE(STRING LOC:test)` now shows the correct type. The parameter extraction regex previously only matched simple identifiers; it now handles `PREFIX:Name` style parameter names and matches both the full prefixed form (`LOC:test`) and the bare name (`test`).
- 🐛 **F12 on overloaded class method implementations now resolves the correct overload** — `MethodOverloadResolver` was scanning for `TokenType.Label` tokens at column 0, but class member methods are tokenized as `Procedure/MethodDeclaration` with an indented label. Fixed to use the class token's `children[]` array (populated by `DocumentStructure`) for direct matching by label and subType. Also removed an incorrect `line > 0` filter that excluded classes declared at the top of a file.
- 🐛 **Find All References no longer triggers on attribute keywords** — words like `ONCE` in `INCLUDE('file.inc'),ONCE` were silently triggering a full cross-file reference scan. Added an `isAttributeKeyword()` early-exit guard to `ReferencesProvider` (same pattern used in `HoverRouter`).
- 🐛 **Find All References no longer hangs on locally-defined class methods** — when running "Find All References" on a method declared in a CLASS body inside the current MEMBER file (e.g. `TakeAccepted PROCEDURE(),DERIVED` in `MetroForm CLASS(ce_MetroWizardForm)` declared inside `Main PROCEDURE` with no `MODULE` attribute), the provider was scanning all source files in every project in the solution, causing an indefinite hang on large solutions. If the class is declared in the current document and has no `MODULE` attribute, the search is now restricted to the current file only. Added a 15-second timeout guard on `textDocument/references` as a safety net.
- ✨ **Multi-level variable chain hover/F12/Ctrl+F12** — `variable.property.method` chains now resolve correctly through CLASS, QUEUE, and GROUP types. For example `thisStartup.Settings.PutGlobalSetting(...)` fully resolves: `thisStartup` → its declared class, `.Settings` → the property type, `.PutGlobalSetting` → the method on that type. Hover shows the correct declaration, F12 navigates to it, and Ctrl+F12 finds the implementation.
- 🐛 **Fix hover/F12 for `PREFIX:Name` reference variables** — variables declared with a colon in their name (e.g. `Access:IBSDataSets &DirectFM,THREAD`) were incorrectly resolved: the old code stripped the prefix before the colon and found an unrelated `IBSDataSets FILE` declaration. Hover and F12 now search the MEMBER parent using the full label name first, so `Access:IBSDataSets` correctly navigates to the reference variable declaration.
- 🐛 **Remove colon-stripping fallback from hover and F12** — a general colon-stripping fallback was stripping `Prefix:` from variable names before searching, causing wrong matches. This fallback is unnecessary because the word extractor already returns the full `Prefix:Name` label (colons are treated as word characters). Structure prefix fields (`PRE(x)` notation) are correctly handled by `findPrefixFieldTokenInChain` without needing this fallback.
- 🐛 **Suppress hover/F12/Ctrl+F12 inside string literals** — hovering or pressing F12/Ctrl+F12 on text inside a quoted string (e.g. `'ContainsSpaces'`) was incorrectly triggering symbol resolution. All three providers now bail out immediately when the cursor falls within a `String` token's span.

**Tests**

- 🔧 **Fix test state pollution in `DefinitionProvider.test.ts`** — added `TokenCache.clearTokens` teardown to all `🔒 Behavior Lock` suites; the `LOC:Field` prefixed variable test was failing only due to cached state from a prior test
- 🧹 **Test suite cleanup** — removed 9 pre-existing pending tests: deleted `UnlabeledGroupNesting.test.ts` (test skipped due to flattened outline), moved `ClassDefinitionIndexer.test.ts` to `server/src/test/env/` (excluded from CI; requires Clarion 11.1 installed). Rescued the one passing `UnlabeledGroupNesting` test into `DocumentSymbolProvider.test.ts`. Fixed cross-test `SolutionManager` singleton dependency in `EquatesScope.test.ts`. Fixed `DocumentHighlightProvider` tests: Clarion labels must be at column 0 to be tokenised as `Label` tokens. Suite now runs at **747 passing, 0 pending, 0 failing**.

### [0.9.1] - 2026-04-14

**Infrastructure**

- 🚀 **Bundle extension with esbuild** ([#56](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/56)) — VSIX drops from ~786 files / 2.5 MB to **30 files / 615 KB**:
  - `esbuild.mjs` bundles client and server into two single-file outputs; only `vscode` remains external
  - 4 data services (`BuiltinFunctionService`, `AttributeService`, `DataTypeService`, `ControlService`) now use static JSON imports instead of `fs.readFileSync` — esbuild inlines the data at bundle time
  - `node_modules/**` excluded from VSIX at root, `client/`, and `server/` — all runtime deps are bundled in
  - Dev workflow (`compile:dev`) is unchanged; only `vscode:prepublish` uses esbuild
- 🔧 **Update GitHub Actions to Node.js 24 compatible versions** ([#57](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/57)) — `actions/checkout@v5`, `actions/setup-node@v5`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4.6.2`
- 🔧 **Add `testrelease.yml` dry-run workflow** — runs the full build/test/package pipeline without merging or publishing; uploads the VSIX as a downloadable artifact for pre-release verification

---

### [0.9.0] - 2026-04-14

**New Features**

- ✨ **Dot-triggered member completion for CLASS instances and `SELF`** ([#54](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/54)) — typing `SELF.` or `MyVar.` now opens a dropdown of all methods and properties on the resolved class:
  - `SELF.` resolves to the enclosing class via `ChainedPropertyResolver`
  - `PARENT.` resolves to the base class
  - `MyVar.` resolves the variable's declared type then enumerates members
  - `ClassName.` enumerates the class directly
  - Full inheritance walk — child members shadow parent members by name
  - `PRIVATE` members visible only within the same class; `PROTECTED` visible in subclasses; `PUBLIC` visible everywhere
  - Chained expressions (`SELF.Order.`) resolve intermediate segment types
  - Each overloaded method appears as a distinct entry (e.g. `AddItem(STRING pText)` and `AddItem(LONG pId, STRING pText)`) with return type shown in the detail column

- ✨ **Signature help for class methods** ([#54](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/54)) — typing `(` after selecting a method from dot-completion (or typing `SELF.Method(` manually) now shows parameter hints; inherits the full inheritance chain so methods from parent classes are found correctly

**Bug Fixes**

- 🐛 **Hover for equates/labels in `INCLUDE` files and `EQUATES.CLW`** — symbols defined in files pulled in via `INCLUDE` statements at the global level (e.g. `KEYCODES.CLW`, `EQUATES.CLW`) now resolve correctly on hover; previously the lookup stopped at the current file
- 🐛 **Hover for equates inside `PROCEDURE` scope** — the INCLUDE chain is now also checked when the cursor is inside a procedure body; the resolver now walks global → module → procedure scope then falls back to all includes in the chain
- 🐛 **Hover for methods on typed variables declared in a parent/include file** — `UD.ShowProcedureInfo` where `UD CLASS(UltimateDebug)` is declared in a parent `.clw` (referenced via `MEMBER`) now shows the correct hover card; the variable type resolver now searches the MEMBER parent when the variable is not found in the current file
- 🐛 **Go to Declaration (F12) for methods on typed variables in parent/include files** — `DefinitionProvider.findClassMemberInIncludes` had the same nested-`END` bug as hover: the raw-text class member scan would exit on the first `END` encountered (e.g. the end of a nested `GROUP`/`QUEUE`/`RECORD`) rather than the end of the `CLASS` block; fixed with `nestDepth` tracking
- 🐛 **Go to Implementation (Ctrl+F12) for typed variables declared in parent/include files** — `ImplementationProvider` only searched the current file for the variable type; a new `findVariableTypeCrossFile()` method now mirrors hover's cross-file lookup (current file → MEMBER parent via `crossFileCache`) so `UD.ShowProcedureInfo` etc. resolve correctly
- 🐛 **`ClassMemberResolver.searchFileForMember` nested-`END` fix** — the shared member-scan utility (used by both hover fallback and GoTo) now tracks `nestDepth` so nested structure blocks inside a `CLASS` do not prematurely terminate the scan

**Refactoring**

- ♻️ **`MemberLocatorService` — unified dot-access resolution** — extracted a single service (`server/src/services/MemberLocatorService.ts`) that owns the entire typed-variable dot-access lookup pipeline (variable type resolution → INCLUDE chain walk → class index lookup → parent class chain). Hover, F12, and Ctrl+F12 all now delegate to this service, eliminating three independent implementations that previously diverged and caused repeated provider-specific bugs (see issue #50)
  - `DefinitionProvider.findClassMemberInIncludes` (raw-text fallback) deleted — replaced by service
  - `DefinitionProvider.findMemberInIncludes` (tokenized walk) deleted — replaced by service
  - `ImplementationProvider.findVariableTypeCrossFile` deleted — replaced by service
  - `ImplementationProvider.findVariableType` deleted — replaced by service
  - `VariableHoverResolver.findVariableTokenCrossFile`, `findGlobalVariableInParentFile`, `searchIncludesForLabel`, `resolveFilePath` deleted — hover now fully delegates cross-file variable lookup to `MemberLocatorService`, completing the unification between hover and GoTo code paths

**Bug Fixes (regression — v0.9.0)**

- 🐛 **Find All References returns only 1 result for MAP procedure calls**
- 🐛 **Find All References for module-scoped symbols incorrectly expanded to all project files** — symbols declared at module level in a MEMBER file (before the first PROCEDURE, per Clarion scope rules) have module scope and are only visible within that MEMBER module. `ReferencesProvider.getFilesToSearch` was falling through to global (all-project) search for any module-scoped symbol in a MEMBER file; it now correctly returns only the declaring file for MEMBER-file module-scoped symbols
- 🐛 **Hover / F12 for procedure-local variables when cursor is inside a ROUTINE** — variables declared in a procedure's local data section (between `PROCEDURE` and `CODE`) are accessible from all `ROUTINE` blocks within that procedure per Clarion scope rules, but `SymbolFinderService.findLocalVariable` only searched within the ROUTINE's own range and never checked the parent procedure's data section. The fix: (1) after the ROUTINE's own search fails, the parent procedure is located via `TokenHelper.getParentScopeOfRoutine` and its data section (before the CODE marker) is scanned for the variable; (2) when the symbol-tree path finds the variable in the parent procedure's data, the returned scope token is now the parent procedure (not the ROUTINE) so FAR searches the entire procedure range instead of just the ROUTINE
- 🐛 **F12 broken for variables declared in a MEMBER parent's INCLUDE chain**— `DefinitionProvider`'s MEMBER parent fallback only read the parent CLW directly and never walked its INCLUDE chain; added `findVariableInParentChain()` to `MemberLocatorService` and replaced the ~60-line manual fallback with a 5-line delegation
- 🐛 **F12 broken for dot-access where the object variable is declared cross-file** — both dot-access entry points in `DefinitionProvider` called `findVariableType()` (current-file only) for step 1 (type resolution); they now first try `memberLocator.resolveVariableType()` (cross-file) and fall back to `findVariableType()` only for non-class types, matching hover's behaviour
- 🐛 **Signature help (`Ctrl+Shift+Space`) missing for methods on cross-file variables** — `SignatureHelpProvider` used its own current-file-only variable type resolver; it now uses `MemberLocatorService.resolveVariableType()` so parameter hints appear for `st.Method()` where `st` is declared in a MEMBER parent or INCLUDE file, consistent with hover and F12
- 🐛 **Signature help missing for `SELF.Method(` when class is defined in the same `.clw` file** — `SignatureHelpProvider.getClassMethodSignatures` used a local token scan that missed classes defined in the current file and never walked the inheritance chain; it now delegates to `MemberLocatorService.enumerateMembersInClass` which handles all cases including inherited methods ([#54](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/54))
- 🐛 **Missing `END` not flagged for window sub-structures** — `DiagnosticProvider.requiresTerminator` only covered data/code structures; `WINDOW`, `REPORT`, `APPLICATION`, `SHEET`, `TAB`, `OLE`, `OPTION`, `MENU`, `MENUBAR`, and `TOOLBAR` now also produce a diagnostic when their closing `END` is absent ([#55](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/55))
