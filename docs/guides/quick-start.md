## Step 2: Open Your First Solution

**Open the folder containing your solution:**

1. Click **File → Open Folder** (or press `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O`)
2. Browse to the folder containing your `.sln` file
3. Click **Select Folder**

**The extension scans for solutions:**

4. Open the **Clarion Tools** sidebar (Activity Bar, left side)
5. You'll see "X Solution(s) Found"  
6. Click the **▶** solution name to open it

This triggers first-time configuration (see Step 3).

### Alternative: Browse for Solution Anywhere

**If your `.sln` is not in the opened folder:**

1. Open the **Clarion Tools** sidebar
2. Click **"📂 Browse for Solution..."**
3. Navigate to and select your `.sln` file
4. The containing folder opens automatically

## Step 3: Configure Clarion Path (First Time Only)

When you open a solution for the first time, you'll be prompted:

1. **Select Clarion Version**
   - Choose your Clarion installation (e.g., "Clarion 11")
   - This sets the path to `ClarionCl.exe` for building

2. **Select Build Configuration**
   - Choose **Release** or **Debug**
   - You can change this later

These settings are saved in `.vscode/settings.json` in your solution folder.
