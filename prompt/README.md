# Prompt Directory

This directory contains reference documentation and context files to assist in development sessions, particularly when working with AI assistants.

## Purpose

- Provide consistent context across multiple development sessions
- Document Clarion language rules and structure
- Maintain issue-specific context for complex problems
- Serve as quick reference for AI-assisted development

## Files

### clarion-language-rules.md
Comprehensive documentation of Clarion language structural rules including:
- Procedure and method structure
- Routine structure and scoping
- Variable declaration rules
- Token types and hierarchy rules

Use this file to provide context about Clarion language structure to AI assistants.

### structure-field-matching-issue.md
Context for specific issues related to structure field matching.

## Usage

When starting a new AI-assisted session, reference relevant files from this directory to provide necessary context without having to re-explain language rules or project-specific patterns.

Example:
```
"Please read the Clarion language rules from prompt/clarion-language-rules.md before we start working on the symbol provider."
```

## Contributing

When adding new files:
1. Use descriptive filenames with `.md` extension
2. Include clear section headers
3. Provide examples where appropriate
4. Update this README with a brief description of the new file
