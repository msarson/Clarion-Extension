## Changelog (What's New in v0.5.6)
### Enhancements
- **Unified Highlighting System**: Added a comprehensive highlighting system for Clarion code elements with a unified configuration structure.
  
  To use this feature:
  1. Configure highlighting options in your settings.json:
     ```json
     "clarion.highlighting": {
       // Enable/disable all highlighting features
       "enabled": true,
       
       // Variable prefix highlighting settings
       "prefix": {
         
         // Define prefixes with simple colors or advanced styling
         "patterns": {
           // Simple color
           "LOCS": "#ffffcc",
           
           // Advanced styling
           "GLOS": {
             "color": "#ccffff",
             "fontWeight": "bold",
             "backgroundColor": "#f0f0f0",
             "before": {
               "contentText": "→",
               "color": "#888888"
             }
           }
         }
       },
       "comment": {
         
         // Define comment patterns with simple colors or advanced styling
         "patterns": {
           // Simple color
           "TODO": "#ff8c00",
           
           // Advanced styling
           "FIXME": {
             "color": "#ff0000",
             "fontWeight": "bold",
             "backgroundColor": "#fff0f0",
             "before": {
               "contentText": "⚠️ ",
               "color": "#ff0000"
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
     
  2. Use VS Code's built-in color picker by clicking on the color values in the settings UI
  
  3. Optionally disable all highlighting with: `"clarion.highlighting.enabled": false`
  
  The extension will automatically apply the selected styles to variables with matching prefixes in your code, and any comment line starting with `!` followed by one of your defined patterns (with or without a space) will be highlighted.
